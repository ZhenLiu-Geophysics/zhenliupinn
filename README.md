## Physics-Informed Neural Network Platform for Next-Generation AVO Inversion

**zhenliupinn** is an open-source platform for pre-stack AVO inversion, building a comprehensive family of physics-informed neural network (PINN) solutions. This project aims to drive next-generation geophysical inversion and reservoir characterization by integrating physics, AI, and Bayesian uncertainty modeling.

## Key Architectures Included

- **CNN-PINN:** Classic convolutional PINN framework.
- **CNN-BiLSTM-PINN:** Sequence modeling enhanced PINN.
- **DC-PINN (Dual-Constraint PINN):** PINN incorporating both physical and numerical constraints (dual-constraint formulation).
- **iPINN:** PINN with learnable wavelet frequency (implicit PINN).
- **BPINN:** Bayesian PINN for uncertainty quantification.
- **iBPINN:** Frequency-adaptive Bayesian PINN.
- **BPI-ViT:** Bayesian Physics-Informed Vision Transformer — the flagship model, enabling structure-level uncertainty quantification and attention-based interpretability (https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-7097139/v3).
- **Future Extensions:** More advanced and innovative PINN-based methods are under development.
